  Fix mutex for dictionary mode.

Version 1.2.0

  Root privileges are not required anymore because cryptsetup is called in
  dry-run mode which does not actually change device mapper configuration.

  This should work under non-root user as long as the user can access the
  device. You can e.g. copy LUKS header to a file and run the cracker on
  this file.
  $ dd if=/dev/source of=/tmp/luks-header bs=1M count=10
